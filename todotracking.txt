Add lowest_ask price for koinex

Enums for currencies (viz. LTC, ETH, BTC, BCH)

Implement parse_args with the following options,
https://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html
--verbose
--exchange (default to gdax-usa and koinex-india)
--notify (accept list of emails to be notified?)
--frequency (How frequently do you want to poll for new quotes - examples : 30s, 1m, 2m, 1h, 6h, 12h, 1d)
--currency ltc (Show results only for LTC coin)
--exchangerate (If this parameter is given then don't download the .exchangerate.json)

Done,
--loop --noloop

print nativePrice too for foriegn exchanges.

Packaging of this so that it can be easily installed and the program can be executed with a command (say "arbitrage")
Example of command,
arbitrage --exchange gdax --exchange koinex --loop --freqency 1m --notify nriarbitrage@gmail.com --verbose

Do exception handling (there is a possiblity of a exception when the downloaded .json files are incorrect due to connectivity issues.)

When json files are downloaded, specify the directory in which they need to be downloaded instead of current directory. If the script is run from home directory, you don't want all those json files in home directory.
